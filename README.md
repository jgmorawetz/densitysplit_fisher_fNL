# densitysplit_fisher_fNL
This repository contains all the codes necessary to reproduce the results in the paper ...

1) Begin by downloading all the Quijote simulation halo catalogs using Globus.

2) Run the codes 'densitysplit_power_fiducial.py' and 'densitysplit_power_LCDM_PNG.py' to generate and save away all power spectrum results.

3) Run 'merge_power_files.py' to combine all the power spectra for each simulation (stored individually) into one file containing all realizations.
